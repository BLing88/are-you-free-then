# Are You Free Then

See my thoughts on this project [here][project-page].

Run `bundle install` to install the dependencies in the Gemfile.

Run `rails db:setup` to create and set up the Postgres database (make sure the database server is already up and [running][postgres].

Run `yarn build` to build the js bundle.

Start the development server with `rails server`.
